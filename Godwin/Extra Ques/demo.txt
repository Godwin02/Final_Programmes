0.Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language.
1.Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.
2.Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
3.Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected.
4.It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.
5.Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
6.Python was created in the late 1980s, and first released in 1991, by Guido van Rossum as a successor to the ABC programming language.
7.Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced new features, such as list comprehensions, and a garbage collection system with reference counting, and was discontinued with version 2.7 in 2020.
8.Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3.
9.With Python 2's end-of-life (and pip having dropped support in 2021[32]), only Python 3.6.x[33] and later are supported, with older versions still supporting e.g. Windows 7 (and old installers not restricted to 64-bit Windows).
10.Python interpreters are supported for mainstream operating systems and available for a few more (and in the past supported many more).
11.A global community of programmers develops and maintains CPython, a free and open-source[34] reference implementation.
12.A non-profit organization, the Python Software Foundation, manages and directs resources for Python and CPython development.
13.As of January 2021, Python ranks third in TIOBEâ€™s index of most popular programming languages, behind C and Java, having previously gained second place and their award for the most popularity gain for 2020.
